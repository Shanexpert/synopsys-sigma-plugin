    <p>
        Ignore any policy violations Sigma has detected if the analyze sub-command is present.
        This is important in order to always report the issues Sigma has found in Jenkins.
        <br />
        If there are policy violations, then Sigma will return a non-zero exit code which will cause Jenkins to fail the build.
        If the build fails due to Sigma policy violations, then the recording of issues Sigma found will not be performed for that build.
        <br />
        If you wish to fail the build due to policy violations, then do not select this option.
        <br />
        If selected, then the '--ignore-policies' command line argument will be added to the Sigma analyze sub-command.
